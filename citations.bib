The software supports short-ranged pair force and bond force fields and achieves optimal GPU performance using an autotuning algorithm. We are able to demonstrate equivalent or superior scaling on up to 3375 GPUs in Lennard-Jones and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations of up to 108 million particles. GPUDirect RDMA capabilities in recent GPU generations provide better performance in full double precision calculations.

	abstract = {We design and implement a scalable hard particle Monte Carlo simulation toolkit (HPMC), and release it open source as part of HOOMD-blue. HPMC runs in parallel on many CPUs and many GPUs using domain decomposition. We employ BVH trees instead of cell lists on the CPU for fast performance, especially with large particle size disparity, and optimize inner loops with SIMD vector intrinsics on the CPU. Our GPU kernel proposes many trial moves in parallel on a checkerboard and uses a block-level queue to redistribute work among threads and avoid divergence. HPMC supports a wide variety of shape classes, including spheres/disks, unions of spheres, convex polygons, convex spheropolygons, concave polygons, ellipsoids/ellipses, convex polyhedra, convex spheropolyhedra, spheres cut by planes, and concave polyhedra. NVT and NPT ensembles can be run in 2D or 3D triclinic boxes. Additional integration schemes permit Frenkel-Ladd free energy computations and implicit depletant simulations. In a benchmark system of a fluid of 4096 pentagons, HPMC performs 10 million sweeps in 10 min on 96 CPU cores on XSEDE Comet. The same simulation would take 7.6 h in serial. HPMC also scales to large system sizes, and the same benchmark with 16.8 million particles runs in 1.4 h on 2048 GPUs on OLCF Titan.},

% Rigid bodies

@article{Nguyen2011,
	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) methods compute the trajectory of a system of point particles in response to a potential function by numerically integrating Newton's equations of motion. Extending these basic methods with rigid body constraints enables composite particles with complex shapes such as anisotropic nanoparticles, grains, molecules, and rigid proteins to be modeled. Rigid body constraints are added to the GPU-accelerated MD package, HOOMD-blue, version 0.10.0. The software can now simulate systems of particles, rigid bodies, or mixed systems in microcanonical (NVE), canonical (NVT), and isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensembles. It can also apply the FIRE energy minimization technique to these systems. In this paper, we detail the massively parallel scheme that implements these algorithms and discuss how our design is tuned for the maximum possible performance. Two different case studies are included to demonstrate the performance attained, patchy spheres and tethered nanorods. In typical cases, HOOMD-blue on a single GTX 480 executes 2.5-3.6 times faster than LAMMPS executing the same simulation on any number of CPU cores in parallel. Simulations with rigid bodies may now be run with larger systems and for longer time scales on a single workstation than was previously even possible on large clusters. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

% PPPM

@article{Lebard2012,
	abstract = {Due to the relatively long time scales inherent to ionic surfactant self-assembly ({\textgreater}$\mu$s), an aggressive computational approach is needed to obtain converged data on micellar solutions. This work presents a study of micellization using a coarse-grained (CG) model of aqueous ionic surfactants in replicated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations run on graphics processing unit hardware. The performance of our implementation of the CG model with electrostatics into the HOOMD-Blue GPU-accelerated MD software package is comparable to that of a modest sized cluster running a highly optimized parallel CPU code. From 0.36 ms of cumulative trajectory data, we are able to predict equilibrium thermodynamic and morphological properties of ionic surfactant micellar solutions. Estimating the critical micelle concentrations (CMC) from the free monomer ($\rho$ 1) and premicellar concentrations obtained from simulations of sodium hexyl sulfate (S6S, CMC of 460 ± 6 mM) at high (1 M) concentration, a value in good agreement with experimental results is obtained; however, the same method applied to simulations of sodium nonyl sulfate (S9S, $\rho$ 1 of 2.4 ± 0.01 mM) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, $\rho$ 1 of 0.02 ± 0.01 mM) at the same total concentration systematically underestimates the CMCs. An alternative method for calculating the CMC is presented, where the free monomer concentration computed from high concentration CG-MD data is used as the input to a simple theoretical model which can be used to extrapolate to a more accurate prediction of the CMC. Better agreement between the empirical and predicted CMC is obtained from this theory for S9S (28.7 ± 0.3 mM) and SDS (3.32 ± 0.04 mM), though the CMC for S6S is slightly underestimated (304 ± 3 mM). We also present statistically converged morphological data, including aggregation number distributions and the principal components of the gyration tensor. This data suggest a transition from spherical micelles to rod-like at a specific aggregation number, which increases with increasing hydrocarbon length. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Many interesting physical phenomena, like crystal nucleation and growth, vacancy motion, and glassy dynamics are challenging to model in these systems because they require detailed dynamical information at the individual particle level. Within the granular materials community the Discrete Element Method has been used extensively to model systems of anisotropic particles under gravity, with friction. We provide an implementation of this method intended for simulation of hard, faceted nanoparticles, with a conservative Weeks–Chandler–Andersen (WCA) interparticle potential, coupled to a thermodynamic ensemble. This method is a natural extension of classical molecular dynamics and enables rigorous thermodynamic calculations for faceted particles.},

Because the depletant particles are statistically independent and the depletion interaction is short-ranged, depletants are randomly inserted in parallel into the excluded volume surrounding a single translated and/or rotated colloid. A configurational bias scheme is used to enhance the acceptance rate. The method is validated and benchmarked both on multi-core processors and graphics processing units for the case of hard spheres, hemispheres, and discoids. With depletants, we report novel cluster phases in which hemispheres first assemble into spheres, which then form ordered hcp/fcc lattices. The method is significantly faster than any method without cluster moves and that tracks depletants explicitly, for systems of colloid packing fraction $\phi$c {\textless} 0.50, and additionally enables simulation of the fluid-solid transition.},

The interaction of the numerous solvent particles with larger particles is coarse-grained as a Langevin thermostat is applied to individual particles or to particle pairs. The Langevin thermostat requires a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to generate the stochastic force applied to each particle or pair of neighboring particles during each time step in the integration of Newton's equations of motion. In a Single-Instruction-Multiple-Thread (SIMT) GPU parallel computing environment, small batches of random numbers must be generated over thousands of threads and millions of kernel calls. In this communication we introduce a one-PRNG-per-kernel-call-per-thread scheme, in which a micro-stream of pseudorandom numbers is generated in each thread and kernel call. These high quality, statistically robust micro-streams require no global memory for state storage, are more computationally efficient than other PRNG schemes in memory-bound kernels, and uniquely enable the DPD simulation method without requiring communication between threads. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The amount of data increases in lockstep with computational efficiency multiplied by the amount of available computational resources, which shifts the bottleneck in the scientific process from data acquisition to data processing and analysis. We present a framework designed to aid in the integration of various specialized data formats, tools and workflows. The signac framework provides all basic components required to create a well-defined and thus collectively accessible and searchable data space, simplifying data access and modification through a homogeneous data interface that is largely agnostic to the data source, i.e., computation or experiment. The framework's data model is designed to not require absolute commitment to the presented implementation, simplifying adaption into existing data sets and workflows. This approach not only increases the efficiency with which scientific results can be produced, but also significantly lowers barriers for collaborations requiring shared data access.},

@article{Ramasubramani2020,
	abstract = {The freud Python package is a powerful library for analyzing simulation data. Written with modern simulation and data analysis workflows in mind, freud provides a Python interface to fast, parallelized C++ routines that run efficiently on laptops, workstations, and supercomputing clusters. The package provides the core tools for finding particle neighbors in periodic systems, and offers a uniform API to a wide variety of methods implemented using these tools. As such, freud users can access standard methods such as the radial distribution function as well as newer, more specialized methods such as the potential of mean force and torque and local crystal environment analysis with equal ease. While many comparable tools place a heavy emphasis on reading and operating on trajectory file formats, freud instead accepts numerical arrays of data directly as inputs. By remaining agnostic to its data source, freud is suitable for analyzing any coarse-grained particle simulation, regardless of the original data representation or simulation method. When used for on-the-fly analysis in conjunction with scriptable simulation software such as HOOMD-blue, freud enables smart simulations that adapt to the current state of the system, allowing users to study phenomena such as nucleation and growth.},

% freud with ML or visualization

@inproceedings{Dice2019,
	abstract = {The freud Python library analyzes particle data output from molecular dynamics simulations. The library's design and its variety of highperformance methods make it a powerful tool for many modern applications. In particular, freud can be used as part of the data generation pipeline for machine learning (ML) algorithms for analyzing particle simulations, and it can be easily integrated with various simulation visualization tools for simultaneous visualization and real-time analysis. Here, we present numerous examples both of using freud to analyze nano-scale particle systems by coupling traditional simulational analyses to machine learning libraries and of visualizing per-particle quantities calculated by freud analysis methods. We include code and examples of this visualization, showing that in general the introduction of freud into existing ML and visualization workflows is smooth and unintrusive. We demonstrate that among Python packages used in the computational molecular sciences, freud offers a unique set of analysis methods with efficient computations and seamless coupling into powerful data analysis pipelines.},

@article{Lechner2008,

As demonstrated using soft particle systems, this averaging procedure considerably improves the accuracy with which different crystal structures can be distinguished.

@article{VanAnders2014c,
	abstract = {Patchy particles are a popular paradigm for the design and synthesis of nanoparticles and colloids for self-assembly. In "traditional" patchy particles, anisotropic interactions arising from patterned coatings, functionalized molecules, DNA, and other enthalpic means create the possibility for directional binding of particles into higher-ordered structures. Although the anisotropic geometry of non-spherical particles contributes to the interaction patchiness through van der Waals, electrostatic, and other interactions, how particle shape contributes entropically to self-assembly is only now beginning to be understood. It has been recently demonstrated that, for hard shapes, entropic forces are directional. A newly proposed theoretical framework that defines and quantifies directional entropic forces demonstrates the anisotropic--that is, patchy--nature of these emergent, attractive forces. Here we introduce the notion of entropically patchy particles as the entropic counterpart to enthalpically patchy particles. Using three example "families" of shapes, we judiciously modify entropic patchiness by introducing geometric features to the particles so as to target specific crystal structures, which then assembled with Monte Carlo simulations. We quantify the emergent entropic valence via a potential of mean force and torque. We generalize these shape operations to shape anisotropy dimensions, in analogy with the anisotropy dimensions introduced for enthalpically patchy particles. Our findings demonstrate that entropic patchiness and emergent valence provide a way of engineering directional bonding into nanoparticle systems, whether in the presence or absence of additional, non-entropic forces.},

@article{VanAnders2014d,
	abstract = {Entropy drives the phase behavior of colloids ranging from dense suspensions of hard spheres or rods to dilute suspensions of hard spheres and depletants. Entropic ordering of anisotropic shapes into complex crystals, liquid crystals, and even quasicrystals was demonstrated recently in computer simulations and experiments. The ordering of shapes appears to arise from the emergence of directional entropic forces (DEFs) that align neighboring particles, but these forces have been neither rigorously defined nor quantified in generic systems. Here, we show quantitatively that shape drives the phase behavior of systems of anisotropic particles upon crowding through DEFs. We define DEFs in generic systems and compute them for several hard particle systems. We show they are on the order of a few times the thermal energy ([Formula: see text]) at the onset of ordering, placing DEFs on par with traditional depletion, van der Waals, and other intrinsic interactions. In experimental systems with these other interactions, we provide direct quantitative evidence that entropic effects of shape also contribute to self-assembly. We use DEFs to draw a distinction between self-assembly and packing behavior. We show that the mechanism that generates directional entropic forces is the maximization of entropy by optimizing local particle packing. We show that this mechanism occurs in a wide class of systems and we treat, in a unified way, the entropy-driven phase behavior of arbitrary shapes, incorporating the well-known works of Kirkwood, Onsager, and Asakura and Oosawa.},

@article{Teich2019,
	abstract = {A universally accepted explanation for why liquids sometimes vitrify rather than crystallize remains hotly pursued, despite the ubiquity of glass in our everyday lives, the utilization of the glass transition in innumerable modern technologies, and nearly a century of theoretical and experimental investigation. Among the most compelling hypothesized mechanisms underlying glass formation is the development in the fluid phase of local structures that somehow prevent crystallization. Here, we explore that mechanism in the case of hard particle glasses by examining the glass transition in an extended alchemical (here, shape) space; that is, a space where particle shape is treated as a thermodynamic variable. We investigate simple systems of hard polyhedra, with no interactions aside from volume exclusion, and show via Monte Carlo simulation that glass formation in these systems arises from a multiplicity of competing local motifs, each of which is prevalent in—and predictable from—nearby ordered structures in alchemical space.},

The cor-nerstone of these studies is the role of shape in self-assembly and in inducing complex order. One challenge is these studies is to quantify different types of order that can emerge in these systems. Here, we revisit the problem of quantifying orientational order in systems of building blocks with non-trivial rotational symmetries. We propose tensorial strong orientational coordinates that fully and exclusively describe the orientation of symmetric objects, and use those to describe and quan-tify local and global rotational order, as well as spatiotemporal correlations in rotational order. These order parameters are not only useful in performing and analyzing computer simulations of anisotropic building blocks, but can also be used for efficient storage of rotational information in long trajectories of molecular simulations.},
